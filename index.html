                <p>
                    It was my first project and I had dedicated it for my friends group.
                    It was obviously fun and it taught me a lot.
                    You can know more about it from here.

                <p>
                    Yup, I am from NISER.
                    I started it thinking that I can kind of show off my Notes and help my fellow friends.
                    I had also thought to unite peope to share their Notes.
                    I realized it's better to focus on class than to focus on Notes.
                    And I dropped it.
                    but now because of my friends and their Notes, it is again continued...

                <p>
                    ya ya ya, this site that you are currently on is my 3rd project in chronological order.
                    It was obviously to show my work and my skills.
                    but It was also to combine all my projects into one.
                    cause I have only one free domain name (by github).
                    and also because the domain name has my name in it not the names of my projects.
                    So, I thought it is a good idea and here it is!

                <p>
                    The story is like this, One of my close friends forgot their pattern lock.
                    I tried to open it but failed badly.
                    I thought to make a website that will help remember what the password was.
                    and here It is.

                <h3>The Cube</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a Cube enthusiast.
                    I knew that every sequence of moves repeates after some repeatation but for some error each time I could not reach till the sequence of moves "RULD" repeats
                    but I finally could determine that aftersome year with some very easy mathmatical logic.
                    and I just decided to use that to create this site where I can check the number of steps after which the given input repeats.

                <h3>Sequence Predictor</h3>
                <p>
                    I was working on colatz conjecture and I needed to see the pattern so i thought to make something that will do this.
                    I tried to do it like take any finite sequence take its difference sequence (sequence of defferences)
                    then the difference sequence of the difference sequence and so on...eventually we will reach a constant or single term sequence
                    and just say that the next term of that sequence to be the same constant sequence we will get a polynomial for our original sequence using that and done we can predict and create a polynomial.
                    i realized that it is not that useful as it takes a lot of assumption
                    but it sometime works like it predicts 31 after 1,2,4,8,16
                    ya its fun! so let it be.

                <h3>Random Points on a circle</h3>
                <p>
                    I was studying Probability to be precise bertrand's paradox, in class we discussed 3 ways of choosing uniformly random points on a circle
                    but to me this didn't look uniform  and I made this to visualize and articulate my doubt
                    it turns out by default I was assuming uniform means areally uniform
                    but uniform is not defined properly so we can define it any how we want and that was what creates the paradox
                    you may also think like me after seeing this but all are in some way uniform.

                <h3>Logic Simulators</h3>
                <p>
                    I was wondering about what is basics of computer but not as basic as electons or semiconductors and I stumbeled up on Logic gates.
                    for some reason I wanted to make DNALogicSimulator and thought it will work on ACGT
                    I needed some experience so I made binary logic Simulator.
                    Then I found out that's not how DNA logic gates work and they are also binary, but that wasn't fun so I still made how I though it to be
                    Then I thought to generalize that more and I made Costum Logic gate Simulator.
                    and you can explore all of them here.
