                    Yup, I am from NISER.
                    I started it thinking that I could kind of show off my Notes and help my fellow friends.
                    I had also thought to unite people to share their Notes.
                    I realized it's better to focus on class than to focus on Notes.
                    And I dropped it.
                    But now because of my friends and their Notes, it is again continued...
                    Ok, it closed again and maybe forever. Anyways, it was a cool project.

                    ya ya ya, this site that you are currently on is my 3rd project in chronological order.
                    It was obviously to show my work and my skills.
                    But it was also to combine all my projects into one.
                    cause I have only one free domain name (by github).
                    and also because the domain name has my name in it, not the names of my projects.
                    So, I thought it is a good idea and here it is!

                <p>
                    I am a Cube enthusiast.
                    I knew that every sequence of moves repeats after some repetition, but due to some error, each time I could not reach the point when the sequence of moves "RULD" repeats
                    but I finally could determine that after some years with some very easy mathematical logic.
                    and I just decided to use that to create this site where I can check the number of steps after which the given input repeats.

                <h3>Sequence Predictor</h3>
                <p>
                    I was working on Collatz conjecture and I needed to see the pattern, so I thought to make something that would do this.
                    I tried to do it like: take any finite sequence, take its difference sequence (sequence of differences),
                    then the difference sequence of the difference sequence, and so on... eventually, we will reach a constant or single-term sequence
                    and just say that the next term of that sequence is the same constant, we will get a polynomial for our original sequence using that, and done, we can predict and create a polynomial.
                    I realized that it is not that useful as it takes a lot of assumptions,
                    but it sometimes works, like it predicts 31 after 1,2,4,8,16.
                    ya, it's fun! so let it be.

                <p>
                    I was studying Probability to be precise, Bertrand's paradox.
                    In class, we discussed 3 ways of choosing uniformly random points on a circle,
                    but to me, this didn't look uniform, and I made this to visualize and articulate my doubt.
                    It turns out, by default, I was assuming uniform means areally uniform,
                    but uniform is not defined properly, so we can define it any way we want and that is what creates the paradox
                    you may also think like me after seeing this, but all are, in some way, uniform.

                <p>
                    I was wondering about what the basics of a computer are but not as basic as electrons or semiconductors and I stumbled upon Logic gates.
                    For some reason, I wanted to make DNA Logic Simulator and thought it would work on ACGT
                    I needed some experience, so I made binary logic Simulator.
                    Then I found out that's not how DNA logic gates work and they are also binary, but that wasn't fun so I still made it how I thought it to be
                    Then I thought to generalize that more and I made Custom Logic gate Simulator.
                    and you can explore all of them here.

                <p>
                    Python is the 1st programming language I learnt. So I had a lot of projects in Python.
                    Though this website comes too late in the list, these projects are mostly beginner projects.
                    I just wanted to show them just, like any other project in this page. Here are some of those.
                    This could have been an easy project If I would have written <code>'await input'</code> instead of <code>'input'</code>, but in python we don't do that, right?
                    and that stubbornness led me to write a parser instead. By the way it works a little differently than python - how? You can see that Here.

                    You've played 2D games, maybe even 3D ones â€” but have you ever played a <strong>1D game</strong>?
                    I define a 1D game where you play only in one dimension!
                    There are games that feel like 1D, like Chrome Dino (the game in chrome when you are offline),
                    but the obstacles appear depending on time but what I want is only and only 1 Dimension. Is it possible?
                    Yes, I made this 1D game, that is purely 1D, only 1 spatial dimension no time dimension.
                    It doesn't depend on time to the extent that I don't even use time for transitions.
                    Oh â€” and you can even use it to send a secret message!

                    I made a purely 1D game and wanted to share it â€” but didn't want to use my voice.
                    So I thought of making a website to generate the narration.
                    What started as a simple tool gradually evolved into a full DSL (Domain-Specific Language).
                    It now includes a parser, syntax highlighting, auto-completion with suggestions, a history stack, a virtual file system, and even mascots!
                    Despite all that, I kept it minimal. And for those who want it even more minimal, there's a blank editor with just syntax highlighting (plus multiple themes).
                    Write your script, set tones and effects, and play it back â€” right in your browser.

                <p>
                    I built a site that generates HTML/CSS code to replicate images. (Why? Because I wanted to!)<br>
                    At first, I planned to detect shapes and create <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s for them â€” but the images I wanted to replicate weren't simple enough.
                    So I went with one <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> per pixel, then tweaked that into what I call the "Strip Method" (yeahâ€¦ I don't know much CSS).
                    I also experimented with a rectangle-merging approach, but ironically, it often performed worse than the naive strip method â€” maybe I'm just stuck in a local minimum!
                    And finally, there's the one-<code>&lt;i&gt;</code> box-shadow trick â€” it feels like cheating, but hey, it works. Try it!
