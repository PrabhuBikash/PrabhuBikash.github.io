                <p>
                    It was my first project and I had dedicated it for my friends group.
                    It was obviously fun and it taught me a lot.
                    You can know more about it from here.

                <h3>NISER Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    Yup, I am from NISER.
                    I started it thinking that I can kind of show off my Notes and help my fellow friends.
                    I had also thought to unite peope to share their Notes.
                    I dropped it cause it nearly beacme an addiction and it hunted me.
                    And I realized its better to focus on class than to focus on Notes.
                    So I dropped it.
                    I may reopen it but for now it is closed.

                <h3>My portfolio</h3>
                <p>
                    ya ya ya, this site that you are currently on is my 3rd project in chronological order.
                    It was obviously to show my work and my skills.
                    but It was also to combine all my projects into one.
                    cause I have only one free domain name (by github) but I need more.
                    and also because the domain name has my name in it not the names of my projects.
                    So, I thought it is a good idea and here it is!
