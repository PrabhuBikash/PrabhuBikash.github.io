                <p>
                    It was my first project and I had dedicated it for my friends group.
                    It was obviously fun and it taught me a lot.
                    You can know more about it from here.

                <h3>NISER Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    Yup, I am from NISER.
                    I started it thinking that I can kind of show off my Notes and help my fellow friends.
                    I had also thought to unite peope to share their Notes.
                    I realized it's better to focus on class than to focus on Notes.
                    And I dropped it.
                    but now because of my friends and their Notes, it is again continued...

                <h3>My portfolio</h3>
                <p>
                    ya ya ya, this site that you are currently on is my 3rd project in chronological order.
                    It was obviously to show my work and my skills.
                    but It was also to combine all my projects into one.
                    cause I have only one free domain name (by github).
                    and also because the domain name has my name in it not the names of my projects.
                    So, I thought it is a good idea and here it is!

                <h3>pattern Finder</h3>
                <p>
                    The story is like this, One of my close friends forgot their pattern lock.
                    I tried to open it but failed badly.
                    I thought to make a website that will help remember what the password was.
                    and here It is.

                <h3>The Cube</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a Cube enthusiast.
                    I knew that every sequence of moves repeates after some repeatation but for some error each time I could not reach till the sequence of moves "RULD" repeats
                    but I finally could determine that aftersome year with some very easy mathmatical logic.
                    and I just decided to use that to create this site where I can check the number of steps after which the given input repeats.
